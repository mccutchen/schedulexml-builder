				<b>NOTE:</b> The courses shown below include a high level of learning support for 
				each student. This high level of support is provided to help students build success 
				at each step in their course. To help build this success students enrolling 
				initially in ECON 2301 will be enrolled in ECON 1303 (self-paced/online) with the 
				same section number. This concurrent enrollment is required unless the student has 
				completed ECON 1303 in a previous semester or is enrolling in a Distance Learning 
				section of ECON 2301.
			</p>
			<p>
				The concurrent ECON 1303 course provides the student with the high level HelpLab 
				support and provides the self-paced preparation ("prepare-as-you-go" course) for 
				ECON 2301. The enhanced HelpLab support includes personal one-to-one tutoring, group 
				test review sessions, multimedia study materials and online practice tests along 
				with personal assistance by telephone and e-mail.
			</p>
			<p>
				ECON 1303 is a transferable credit course, is a Core Curriculum course and can be 
				taken independently online (see Distance Learning section below) or, as indicated 
				above, will be taken concurrently with ECON 2301.
			</p>
			<p>
				The orientation for the concurrent ECON 1303 is part of the orientation for the 
				ECON 2301 course carrying the same section number. If there are any questions, please 
				come by the ECON HelpLab, Room M130, call 972-860-4169 or 972-860-4164, or e-mail 
				Gus Herring at gHerring@dcccd.edu with a copy to Bob Smith at bSmith1@dcccd.edu.
